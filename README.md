# Rewards App

### Starting the Application

To run the application you have to run the maria db in docker, so:
1. Run `docker-compose up` to start the DB
2. After the DB is up, simply run the Application


### Running tests
Tests are configured to be run with an in-memory DB, which means you don't have to have the DB server running.
- To run tests simply do `Run 'All tests'` in your IDE


### API testing
- To test the API-s, I have included the postman calls which are ready to be imported,
and can be found in the `postman-collection.json` file in root dir.
